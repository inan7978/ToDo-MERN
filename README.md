## ToDo-MERN

- This is the ToDo app that has been recreated with the full MERN stack.
- I used React.js for the front-end (client), MongoDB for database, and Express.js to handle the communication between the two using REST API.
- This ensures the tasks are not reset with each launching of the app.

- Fun fact: It is currently running internally on the network of a house I am renting a room in. My roomates and I use it to delegate and coordinate on which chores need to be done and have been done around the house.

# How To Run It

- To run it, simply clone the repo.
- Go into the server directory and "npm i". Then "npm start" to start it up.
- After this, go into the client directory, "npm i" again and "npm start" to fire it up.
- Enjoy!
